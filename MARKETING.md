# Skill Check — Marketing Kit

## Positioning

**Category:** AI supply-chain safety for agent skills

**One-liner:**
Skill Check is a security gate for OpenClaw/ClawHub skills that scans before install and returns a clear verdict: APPROVED, CAUTION, or REJECT.

## Value pillars

1. **Secure by default** — enforce audit before install
2. **Fast decisions** — policy-based scoring and concise verdicts
3. **Operator-friendly** — shell guard + repeatable CLI workflow
4. **Pragmatic output** — findings + remediation, not noise

## Launch announcement (EN)

We just upgraded **Skill Check** with install enforcement.

You can now route skill installs through a mandatory security gate:
- audit first
- block unless verdict is APPROVED
- keep an auditable report trail

If you install third-party skills, this should be your default workflow.

## Launch announcement (PT-BR)

Acabamos de evoluir o **Skill Check** com enforcement de instalação.

Agora você pode forçar um gate de segurança antes de instalar skills:
- audita primeiro
- bloqueia se não for APPROVED
- mantém trilha de auditoria

Se você instala skills de terceiros, esse deveria ser o seu fluxo padrão.

## Short social post (X/LinkedIn)

Installing AI skills without a security gate is the new “curl | bash”.

`skill-check` now supports enforced pre-install auditing for ClawHub/OpenClaw skills:
✅ APPROVED
⚠️ CAUTION
⛔ REJECT

Ship faster. Ship safer.

- “Use `scripts/safe_install.sh <slug>` to enforce pre-install audits.”
- “Enable shell guard once and route `clawhub install` through policy checks.”
- “Adopt security-by-default for your skill supply chain.”
